# Prison-Break

### This is a  Dataquest Guided Project!


## What I do in this project:

* Obtain real data from the Internet and prepare it for analysis
* Analyze the data using Python
* Author our first portfolio project in Jupyter Notebook, to share code and communicate results

*This project mainly answers these two questions:*

1 - In which year did the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occur?

2 - In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?

## Results
