# Prison-Break

### This is a  Dataquest Guided Project!


## What I do in this project:

* Use real data from the open source on the Internet and clean it for analysis
* Analyze the data using Python


*This project mainly answers these two questions:*

1 - In which year were there the most attempts to escape out of prison using a helicopter?

2 - Which countries have the highest number of attempted jail escapes via helicopter?

## Results

1- With a total of three attempts each, the years 1986, 2001, 2007, and 2009 have the most helicopter jail escape attempts.

2 - France has far and away the most attempted helicopter jail escapes.
